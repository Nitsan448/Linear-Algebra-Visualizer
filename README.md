**A learning tool that allows experimentation with Linear Algebra concepts.**

Each main aspect of the tool has a manager script,<br/>
which exposes important variables, method and actions regarding this part.

For example, the **TransformationsManager** holds the value of the transformation matrix,<br/>
methods such as **InvertMatrix** and **TransposeMatrix**,<br/>
and the **MatrixUpdated** action, which allows the UI to update and show the new matrix.

### Built With

C#, Unity.

## Features

* Visualization of vector operations - Addition, Projection, Reflection, Dot product and Cross product,<br/>
and of matrix transformations applied on an object's vertices, position, rotation, or scale.
* Easy control over matrix and vector values, using mouse, text, or utility methods.
* Visualization of an axis system, planes and vectors.
