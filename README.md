## Overview

A learning tool that allows experimentation with Linear Algebra concepts.

The architecture for this project is the following:
Every main part of the project has a manager,
which exposes important variables, method and actions regarding this part.

For example, the **TransformationsManager** holds the value of the transformation matrix,
methods such as **InvertMatrix** and **TransposeMatrix**,
and the **MatrixUpdated** action, which allows the UI to update when the matrix was updated

### Built With

C#, Unity.
